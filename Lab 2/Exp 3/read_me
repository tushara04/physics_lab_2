    The aim of the experiment is to study the concept of electromagnetic damping and understand how the motion of a mass is affected under the effects of electromagnetic damping. In addition, the concepts of tension and frictional torque with regards to a circular disk and axle are understood in relation to acceleration and suspended mass. For each part, we describe the procedure we followed to carry out the experiments. The data obtained are then analyzed using the theoretically known information about the pendulum.
